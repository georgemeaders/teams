# teams
4 Teams have to donate 5 players each to a pool in order to help fund a new startup team.  
Click the button to randomly sort the draft pool. 
The first player of each position is selected to be put into the new team (Center, Small Forward, Power Forward, Shooting Guard, Point Guard).
Click the next button to see the players the new team has received.

The JQuery algorithm to shuffle the DOM elements was taken from James Padolsey.
